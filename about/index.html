		<h1>About</h1>

		<div class="about-wrapper">
			<h2><span role="img" aria-label="Bearded Man">&#129492;&#127995;</span> Bio</h2>
			<p><strong>Organic, farm-raised human.</strong> With an interactive journalism degree, and three years of experience managing design, development, and product engagements, I bring my storytelling and engineering background to each project. I’m as comfortable discussing complex API integrations as I am editing impactful copywriting. I’m a Certified Professional of Accessibility Core Competencies (CPACC) and I work every day to make the web a more equitable place.</p>
			<p>Originally from a soybean farm in Maryland, I now live and work in Washington, DC. At Viget, I lead digital engagements for clients like the Human Rights Campaign, Arcadia, and the NFL Players Association.</p>

			<h2><span role="img" aria-label="Heart">&#10084;&#65039;</span> Philosophy</h2>
			<p>I believe in doing good, and doing it well.</p>

			<h3>Clear, transparent communication.</h3>
			<p>When working with clients and internal teams, I tell the truth – and I expect the same of others. I sleep best after sending a well-worded email, GitHub issue, project plan, or meeting recap.</p>

			<h3>Hands-on collaboration.</h3>
			<p>Project management isn’t just telling people what to do. Often, it’s doing the work alongside the team. In the last year, I've made <a href="https://github.com/peytonchance">677 GitHub contributions</a> (mostly tickets & simple PRs) and made countless design tweaks in <a href="https://figma.com">Figma</a>. I’m a digital generalist with a Google Calendar habit.</p>

			<h3>Digital accessibility.</h3>
			<p>I believe that the digital world is for all people - including those with physical, mental and economic barriers to access. Accessibility is an equity challenge that can only be met with knowledge. I’m a Certified Professional of Accessibility Core Competencies (CPACC) and I’m working toward a certification as a Web Accessibility Specialist. At Viget, I lead accessibility QA to WCAG 2.1 standards, and advocate for testing across device tiers.</p>

			<h3>LGBTQIA+ inclusion.</h3>
			<p>I care about making the world a better place for LGBTQIA+ people to live and work. Together with queer colleagues, I've worked to increase the visibility of LGBTQIA+ people at Viget and even led a <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Iyqw1zAFRm2TT5Tww6_fonv4CSZtWSj_BZ-nDi_p8Y8/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">lunch discussion on queer identity</a>.</p>
